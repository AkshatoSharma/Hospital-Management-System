# Hospital-Management-System

This C++ program implements a basic hospital management system using object-oriented programming principles such as inheritance, polymorphism, static variables, friend functions, operator overloading, and templates. The system manages patient details, doctor assignments, internships, hospital expenses, and collects ratings for services. It provides functionalities like patient admission, room and bed allotment, calculating medical expenses, doctor salary based on shifts worked, managing internships and stipends, and summing hospital expenses. Exception handling ensures the eligibility of doctors for surgery participation, while template classes allow flexibility in collecting hospital service ratings. The system's main menu directs users to various functionalities based on whether they are a patient, doctor, or interested in hospital services, making it versatile for hospital management tasks.
